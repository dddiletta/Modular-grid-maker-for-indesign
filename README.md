This tool generates modular and baseline grids for InDesign documents based on page size and a few parameters.

Installation
Download the “Modular-grid-maker-working.js” script
Open your Scripts panel (Windows > utilities > scripts)
Right click on “User” and click “Reveal in Finder”
Add “Modular-grid-maker-working.js” to the folder
InDesign should now display the script in the panel

Use
Start a new (or open an existing) InDesign file with whatever height and width you want (margins and bleeds will be generated in the script)
Double click the Modular-grid-maker-working.js script
You will be prompted with a user input window asking for a grid number. This number will be used to create both horizontal and vertical guides
You will next be prompted to enter a leading size (this will be used to create your baseline grid system as well as ratio-based grid gutters)
The script will then resize your document to create a page size that holds both your modular grid and your baseline grid together and create the modular grid, baseline grid, gutters, and margins.
